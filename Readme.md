<br>
<img src="PCIU-Evoting Flowchart.png"/>
<br>

- **PC1**: Runs Node.js/Express backend + MongoDB. Hosts Commissioner Control Panel.  
- **PC2**: React-based frontend for Students. Connects to PC1 backend APIs over LAN.  

---

## Workflow

1. Commissioner logs in and configures election (**candidates + voters**).  
2. Commissioner **starts election**.  
3. Students log in with **Student ID** → system verifies eligibility.  
4. Eligible students **cast their vote**.  
5. Commissioner **stops election** and exports results.  

---

## Security
- **JWT authentication** for Commissioner.  
- **One-vote-per-student** enforcement.  
- Encrypted voter and vote data in **MongoDB**.  
- **LAN-only deployment** prevents external cyber attacks.  

---

### LAN Configuration
1. Connect **PC1 (server)** and **PC2 (client)** in the same LAN.  
2. Assign **static IPs** to both PCs.  
3. Update frontend `.env` file to point API base URL → `http://<PC1_IP>:<PORT>`.
